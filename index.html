                        I am a third-year undergraduate student about to complete a Bachelor of Computer Science 
                        at Griffith University with a specific focus on distributed systems and networking. I am 
                        aspiring to become a software developer in the space and communication industries and 
                        completing my degree is only one of many steps.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I have always firmly believed that I would complete tertiary study one day, and although 
                        it took me a while to start, I know I have definitely made the right choice. My study at 
                        Griffith has brought me the opportunity to undertake a WIL placement with the space company, 
                        Gilmour Space Technologies. Never would I have thought that I would be working for a space 
                        company, but through Griffith, here on the Gold Coast I was able to. With Gilmour I was able 
                        to write software that will eventually go up on the ‘Joey’ satellite into space. I was 
                        involved in the design of specific modules that will allow network communication between 
                        the satellite and a ground station which will be essential for the sending and receiving 
                        of telemetry and command messages.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My goals are to continue the development of my skills in writing flight software for 
                        satellites by continuing to work with Gilmour if possible. I am looking at completing my 
                        Honours with courses and a thesis which are relevant to space communications and even 
                        continuing an to complete a PhD are top goals of mine. I think space is the ultimate 
                        frontier and would love to be a part of the pioneering push!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, on that note I am still open to all and any opportunity to further my skills 
                        in these industries and welcome all prospective employers, leaders, entrepreneurs, and 
                        even other students to engage with me to see if we can collaborate in some way! Please 
                        have a read of my ePortfolio and if you have any questions don’t hesitate to reach out.

                        My placement was an overall very enjoyable experience however at the beginning I did feel overwhelmed 
                        by what I had to learn. During the first few weeks I found myself 
                        confused over what to focus on and what I should prioritise as many things seemed equally as important.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I was juggling learning a new programming language, a new middleware system written in a different 
                        language, how to approach the programs I was meant to write, the paradigm 
                        of test-driven development, and the paradigm of deterministic real-time systems which is important 
                        for satellite software. I found it very challenging to synthesise all these different things and I 
                        felt quite lost over the days where I did not have face-to-face contact with the GSAT team, especially 
                        in the first few weeks.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However after several weeks of going to the placement office and attending the weekly meetings I gradually 
                        began to understand my task. I was able to ask questions from the senior software developers and another
                        student doing their WIL placement with the team and this allowed me to get a grasp on how I could start
                        approaching my placement deliverables. This reinforced to me the importance of making myself available
                        at every opportunity to have face-to-face contact with other people and to ask as many questions
                        as possible. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There were many opportunities where I did not need to be present at a meeting or I had the opportunity 
                        to work from home, but it proved very valuable to me that I did make the effort. This motivation is a 
                        skill I wish to solidify by reminding myself how it helped me get through the first few weeks of the 
                        placement.

                    <p>
                        I also thought that my code-writing skills would be quite good since I had spent the best part of the 
                        last three years writing lots of code. I had heard that the Swift programming language had a relatively 
                        easy learning curve, so I was happy to dive in. While I am confident in my ability to write code in 
                        Swift, writing code that follows good software engineering practices such as the SOLID principles is 
                        a skill I hope to develop further.

                            of the programs I had to create.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After designing the class diagram shown above, I was able to use my knowledge of object-oriented programming to 
                        write the code for the socket structures that would be added to the SwiftCFS library that was being 
                        created by the GSAT software development team. The socket structures were Swift wrappers of the cFE 
                        middleware socket functions that were written in C. As this was my first-time writing wrapper code, 
                        I found it challenging as I wasn’t sure of what things I would need to account for. I had 
                        to take account of what a user of my software modules would want and what they would not care about. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The senior software developer who was supervising me gave me guidance throughout the process which 
                        gave me tremendous confidence and I felt very motivated to complete the task. My work went through 
                        many different code reviews, and I didn’t mind this. In fact, the code reviews were where I learnt 
                        the most. This process reminded me that while I have a decent understanding on how to write code, 
                        I need to develop my software engineering practices further. I am now much more invested in cementing 
                        my software engineering skills based on the SOLID principles, and so I am looking at staying on at 
                        Gilmour Space and continuing to work on my contribution to the SwiftCFS library over the summer period.

                        The cFS software framework is an industry-grade middleware developed by NASA that
                        is used for satellite flight software. This framework is written in C and has many built
                        in operating-system agnostic features including socket functionality. I had to learn 
                        how the cFS works to create a Swift interface for some of its functionality.
