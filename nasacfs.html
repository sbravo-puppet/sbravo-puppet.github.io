            <h3>Technical Skill: cFS middleware and socket functionality</h3>
            <p>
                Satellites and ground stations together can be considered a distributed system 
                and a common software architecture for providing low-level system functions 
                such as communication and data management can be provided by a middleware. 
                The onboard computer of the ‘Joey’ satellite which our team was working on 
                currently relies on a NASA-developed middleware called the core Flight System (cFS) 
                to provide low-level system functionality. The cFS would be run on top of the 
                satellite’s linux operating system and any extra functionalities created by the 
                team would sit on top of the cFS (hence cFS being the middleware). My main 
                placement deliverable was to create a cFS application that would handle sending 
                messages between the satellite and the ground station.
            </p>

            <!-- <h3>Actions</h3> -->
            <p>
                At first, I had no idea what a cFS application meant and how I would go about 
                creating it. Fortunately, I was able to leverage experience from my <em>Robotics, 
                Agents and Reasoning</em> course where I wrote several modules for a middleware called 
                ROS (Robot Operating System). This experience coupled with many questions and many 
                hours of studying the Gilmour Space GitHub repository allowed me to work out what 
                sort of system-level functions the cFS provided, how messaging was handled by the 
                cFS, and how I would leverage these things to design and write my own modules. 
                Once I began to understand how the cFS worked, I was quickly able to write code 
                to create a telemetry message. From here I worked out that I would be using the 
                cFS socket functions to send the message and I was also able to draw on my 
                experience with sockets from my <em>Systems and Distributed Computing</em> course to start 
                writing modules in Swift that would provide socket functionality to the rest of 
                the satellite.
            </p>

            <!-- <h3>Results</h3> -->
            <p>
                By applying my knowledge with ROS and distributed computing I was able to create 
                several polished software modules. These were tested and merged onto the development 
                branch of the Gilmour Space GitHub repository where they will be used by other 
                software modules to establish a network connection between the satellite and a 
                ground station.
            </p>

            <!-- <h3>Learning</h3> -->
            <p>
                I learnt from this experience many different aspects about how middleware is used, 
                specifically what functionalities the cFS can provide to a satellite system. I was 
                able to solidify and extend my knowledge of sockets; how sockets can be configured 
                for receiving or sending data, whether using connectionless or connection-oriented 
                protocols and what this would mean for a user. This experience will aid me 
                significantly in my future endeavours working with distributed systems and networks.
