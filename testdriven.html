                <h3>Transferable skill: Test-driven development</h3>
                <p>
                    Test-driven development (TDD) is not something that came easily for me. I normally 
                    tested any code I would write by (compiling if need be first) executing it and 
                    checking to see if the entire program would run. Any rigorous testing using test 
                    cases (if at all) would occur after I had a suitably working program. However, during my 
                    placement at Gilmour I was required to continuously create test cases of my code 
                    as I went along and in fact, I was encouraged to create the test cases before I 
                    wrote the source code. This methodology was quite different to how I had approached 
                    software development before. Fortunately, the Swift package manager creates a 
                    working environment that is highly conducive to TTD by creating a separate 
                    directory to save the tests and using the command ‘swift run’ would compile 
                    and run all tests.
                </p>

                <!-- <h3>Actions</h3> -->
                <p>
                    For my Milestone 1 deliverable I did not really understand what type of tests I 
                    should store in my test directory as I was still stuck in the mindset of needing 
                    to have code that works and runs first. Trying to foresee what I could test 
                    without having written the code for something seemed beyond me. I was also trying 
                    to juggle all the new things I had to learn so Milestone 1 my testing was limited. 
                    In fact, I wrote all the code into my source files including a ‘driver’ script 
                    that would call all my functions in a specific order, and then in my test 
                    directory I created one test function that would call the driver. This was not 
                    how TTD is performed but it was a steppingstone in my road to understanding TTD. 
                </p>

                <!-- <h3>Results</h3> -->
                <p>
                    For my Milestone 2 deliverable, I had had more exposure to the Swift working 
                    environment, the Gilmour GitHub repository and with the guidance of my 
                    supervisors, I began to write tests into my test directory as soon as I added 
                    functions to my source code. I then recalled that I had created formal documentation 
                    of test cases in my <em>Software Engineering Fundamentals</em> course, so I drew on this 
                    experience in creating them for Milestone 2. 
                </p>

                <!-- <h3>Learning</h3> -->
                <p>
                    It was a gradual process, but I started to view my source code in terms of what I 
                    could test, and this became very enjoyable as it gave me more confidence that I was 
                    writing code to a decent standard. I think learning TDD is crucial for industry where 
                    software development needs to be more rigorous, and it forces you to understand 
                    your code from the point of view of other users.
