                <h3>Teaching touch in Bandung</h3>
                <p>
                As a part of the intensive Indonesian language course I attended while in the Army,
                the students and teachers spent two weeks in Indonesia doing various language exercises everyday.
                The students had to pick from a range of different communication assignments to showcase our
                ability to use the Indonesian language, and my assignment was to deliver a Physical Training
                (PT) class to a group of Year 12 students at a school in Bandung, Indonesia. Not only did
                this showcase my ability to communicate to a group, but to a group of people from a 
                different culture and using a different language. 
                </p>
                <p>
                When I was first given the task of delivering a PT class to students at a school, I 
                had to assess what sort of subject I could effectively communicate to the students
                without getting bogged down with too much intricate terminology. I also wanted to
                make sure I could get my ideas across and ensure the students wouldn't get bored 
                and would enjoy the class. I decided to teach them how to play Touch Footy, 
                (modified rugby league rules) as I was an avid player at the time and this made
                the task a lot easier as I had a passion for this sport. I practiced delivering
                my lesson to colleagues and Indonesian counterparts before my final assignment.
                The assignment was recorded and assessed.
                </p>
                <p>
                The PT class was a success, I was able to effectively communicate the
                basic concepts behind playing Touch Footy and the whole class was able to
                play and they had a great time!  The PT teacher for the school even got 
                in and played the game and said that he would like to implement Touch Footy
                into the curricular and asked for a copy of the rules. As a further result,
                on completion of this course I was given the following 
                <a href="feedback.html" target="_parent">feedback</a> by the
                head lecturer of the language course when I was awarded a Diploma of
                Vocational Indonesian Language.
                </p>
                <p>
                The main thing I learnt from this experience was that if you want to communicate a 
                message effectively, doesn't matter what language you speak, if you make it fun then
                it is easier to get your message across. In this case, it was creating an engaging
                sporting environment but in another case it may mean injecting some humour into
                what you say.
