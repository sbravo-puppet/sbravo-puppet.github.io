                <h3>Completing the Kapooka Challenge</h3>
                <p>
                When I first joined the Army in 2007 I wasn't sure what I was in for, but you do quickly find out 
                what it's all about when you get to Kapooka, just outside of Wagga Wagga in NSW. During the recruit 
                training you are taught the basic core skills of a soldier and that includes the Army's core 
                values which are Courage, Initiative, Respect and Teamwork. During the final phase of recruit 
                training, as a platoon (team of 30 - 40) we had to work together to negotiate an obstacle course, 
                bayonet assault course and conduct a coordinated attack on a notional enemy. All of which requires 
                people to follow orders and carry out their roles and look after their mates. Teamwork is of the 
                utmost importance.
                </p>
                <p>
                This was one of the first times I had really been pushed and where I was required to use the skills 
                I had learnt in the previous 10 weeks. Myself and another person were selected to be the Lead Scouts 
                of the platoon, which required us to always be at the far front while the platoon was moving. Our 
                jobs included relaying information back to the section commander and to the rest of the team. During 
                the coordinated attack, we were always required to stretcher carry some of our notionally wounded 
                team mates. This required coordinated teamwork so that we weren't always carrying the same sides 
                of the stretcher.
                </p>
                <p>
                Got through the 'Kapooka Challenge' and graduated from 1 Recruit Training Battalion (1RTB) and went 
                from being 'Recruit' to 'Private'. I learnt so much from my time at Kapooka about teamwork. People 
                from all walks of life from all over Australia are forced to work together as a close-knit team, 
                and have to be able to rely on them to not only do multiple-person jobs, but also for motivation 
                and emotional support. We were always told to spur our mates on, to make sure we use our voices, 
                loud and clear, so that everyone knew we were part of the team!
                </p>
                <p>
                I learnt a lot about myself from this experience; that I was able to push myself past 
                mental and physical boundaries I had not yet tested and that many hands make light work!
                Understanding that a team works well when everyone gets in and helps but also when there 
                is a common goal and everyone supports everyone else. This is the type of mental attitude
                I intend on bringing to future endeavours.
